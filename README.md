# PawPals, LBAW 2024/2025 GROUP 121

## Overview
PawPals is a social network designed for the pet community. It allows pet owners to connect, share daily pet activities, discuss pet care, and promote pet adoption and rescue. Developed over four months as part of the LBAW course at the University of Porto, this project showcases a server-side web application built using the Laravel PHP framework and PostgreSQL database.

The final version of the platform can be accessed here: [PawPals Repository](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24121).

## How to Run the Application with Docker
To deploy the application using Docker, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name lbaw24121 -p 8000:80 gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24121
```
Once the container is running, open your browser (we recommend Google Chrome) and navigate to:
```bash
http://localhost:8000/home
```
From there, you can use the platform as a guest, register a new account, or log in using the credentials provided below.
